### ◾ Italian Tribunal Districts <br />
The geographical competence of the Italian tribunals has been reformed in 2012. I refer to the Serie Generale n.213 del 12-09-2012 - Supplemento Ordinario n. 185, Table A of the Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana to map the municipalities covered by 135 tribunal districts. As all the other sources I consult provide data for 140 tribunals, I manually reconstruct the geographical competence for five of them, consulting the tribunals’ webpages. In particular, the Tribunals of Avezzano and Sulmona appear aggregated with L’Aquila; Lanciano and Vasto with Chieti; Urbino.

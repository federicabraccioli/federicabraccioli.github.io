# Job Market Paper
**"The Institutional Role of the Italian Mafia: Enforcing Contracts When the State Does Not"** - [<span style="color:blue">draft</span>](https://federicabraccioli.github.io/files/Braccioli_MafiaInstitution_JMP.pdf)  <br />
**Abstract** - Italy has one of the slowest judicial systems in Europe. At the same time, there exists anecdotal evidence suggesting that informal contract enforcement can be provided by organized crime. I present a simple theoretical framework to explain why citizens may turn to the Mafia for contract enforcement when the State is increasingly unable to fulfil this service. I empirically test the main model prediction using a novel database of Mafia-controlled areas across Italy between 2014 and 2019. I obtain confidential yearly data from the Superior Council of the Judiciary about the judgeâ€™s retirement, which I use as a source of exogenous variation in the Stateâ€™s enforcement capacity. Results indicate that the Mafia expands its control over the territory when the State weakens its contract enforcement capacity. <br />

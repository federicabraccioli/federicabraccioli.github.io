# About RViE <br />

**WHO WE ARE** <br />
We are Ph.D. students in Economics, some of us are “rare voices*”, and others are not. We all believe that our profession could do better both in terms of individual experience and productivity via better allocation of talents. Creating a safe space for diverse voices to express themselves can benefit everybody. Our mission is to keep this discussion open and advocate for change at the institutional level. <br />

**WHAT WE DO** <br />
**[1] Raising awareness and fostering an open exchange** through our workshops. We review relevant scientific papers and reflect during our occasional roundtables with experts in the field. <br />
**[2] Leveling the playing field** through our [<span style="color:blue">mentoring program</span>](https://www.rarevoicesineconomics.com/mentoring) and theater workshops to empower PhD students in building networks and mastering challenging environments. <br />
**[3] Promoting institutional change** via our [<span style="color:blue">guidelines</span>](https://www.rarevoicesineconomics.com/rvie-guidelines) for more inclusive economics departments and regular participation to [<span style="color:blue">departments' public events</span>](https://www.rarevoicesineconomics.com/iee-research-day). <br />
**[4] Creating a safe space for research** using our [<span style="color:blue">research clusters</span>](https://www.rarevoicesineconomics.com/research-clusters) and our annual [<span style="color:blue">Rare Voices in Economics conference</span>](https://www.rarevoicesineconomics.com/conference). During these events, we create secure and stimulating places to discuss research. <br />

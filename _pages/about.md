### Postdoctoral Researcher at the IAE-CSIC and Barcelona School of Economics.

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute for Economic Analysis (IAE-CSIC) and the Barcelona School of Economics (BSE). I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Geneva. 

My main research interests are Political and Labor Economics. My work on Political Economy focuses on contract enforcement institutions and organized crime. I study the consequences of ineffective civil tribunals on the presence of organized crime, new measures of organized crime activities, and their persistence over time. I also study Labor and Education Economics, particularly the effect of the college major choice on labor market outcomes in the context of multiple unordered choices. 

I am co-founder of [Rare Voices in Economics](https://www.rarevoicesineconomics.com/), an association that implements strategies to break self-perpetuating mechanisms that inhibit diversity and inclusion in the economic profession.

## IEE Ph.D. Mentoring Program (University of Geneva)

**Founder and co-organizer** <br />
Academic years: *2020-2021, 2021-2022, 2022-2023* <br />

During the Fall Semester of 2020, I founded the IEE Ph.D. Mentoring Program. Motivated by the negative shock COVID-19 had on our community, I wanted to create opportunities for new Ph.D. students to meet their seniors. I ran the program with [<span style="color:blue">Kyungbo Han</span>](https://sites.google.com/view/kyungbohan/) in 2021-2022. I have been an active mentor as well.  <br />

Mentees: Felipe Fausto *(2020-2021)* and Cecilia Carvalho *(2022-2023)*
